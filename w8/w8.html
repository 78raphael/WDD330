        <p class="title">Chapter 8: CSS Transformations and Transitions</p>

        <p>Transforms
          <ul>
            <li>transform property: translate, rotate, scale, and/or skew any element on the page</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>Translation
          <ul>
            <li>Translation functions allow you to move elements left, right, up, or down</li>
            <li>These functions are similar to the behavior of position: relative; when declaring top and left, moving elements up and down or left and right along the x and y axes</li>
            <li>The translate(x,y) function moves an element x from the left, and y from the top</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          Scaling
          <ul>
            <li>scale(x,y) function scales an element by the defined factors horizontally then vertically</li>
            <li>If only one value is provided, it will be used for both the x and y values, growing or shrinking your element or pseudo-element while maintaining the original aspect ratio</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>Rotation
          <ul>
            <li>rotate() function rotates an element around the point of origin by a specified angle value</li>
            <li>by default, the point of origin is the element’s center</li>
            <li>angles are declared in degrees, with positive degrees moving clockwise and negative moving counterclockwise</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          Skew
          <ul>
            <li>skew(x,y) function specifies a skew along the x and y axes</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>Changing the transform origin
          <ul>
            <li>transform-origin property: control the origin from which your transforms are applied</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>Transitions
          <br>
          Steps to create a simple transition using only CSS:
          <ol>
            <li>Declare the original state of the element in the default style declaration</li>
            <li>Declare the final state of your transitioned element; for example, a :hover state</li>
            <li>Include the transition functions in your default style declaration using the transition properties, including: transition-property, transition-duration, transition-timing-function, and transition-delay</li>
          </ol>
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>TRANSITION-PROPERTY
          <ul>
            <li>defines the CSS properties of the element that should be transitioned, with all for all properties being the default.</li>
            <li>You can provide any number of CSS properties to the transition-property declaration, separated by commas</li>
            <li>To support older WebKit browsers, you need to include the -webkit- prefix for all of your transition properties</li>
            <li>Include the -webkit- prefix for all the transition properties, not just the transition-property property</li>
            <li>If you want to transition more than one property, but not all, comma-separate them</li>
            <li>the transition-property property has no effect; that’s because we still need to specify the duration of the transition</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>TRANSITION-DURATION
          <ul>
            <li>sets how long the transition will take: the duration of time it takes to go from the default state to the transitioned state</li>
            <li>specify this either in seconds (s) or milliseconds (ms)</li>
            <li>200ms is generally considered the optimum time for a transition: anything slower will make the website seem slow, drawing generally unwanted attention to what was supposed to be a subtle effect. Anything faster may be too subtle</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>TRANSITION-TIMING-FUNCTION
          <ul>
            <li>lets you control the pace of the transition in even more granular detail</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>TRANSITION-DELAY
          <ul>
            <li>introduce a delay before the transition begins</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>MULTIPLE TRANSITIONS
          <ul>
            <li>If you want your properties to transition at different rates, or if you just want a select few to have a transition effect, include them as a comma-separated list containing, at minimum, the transition-property and transition-duration for each</li>
            <li>Simply include each value in a comma-separated list using the same order as the transition-property for all your longhand transition property declarations</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>Animations
          <ul>
            <li>CSS animations: allow you to control each step of an animation via keyframes</li>
            <li>Keyframe: a snapshot that defines a starting or end point of any smooth transition</li>
            <li>Keyframes can be specified in any order; it’s the percentage values rather than the order of the declarations that determine the sequence of keyframes in the animation</li>
            <li>Once we have defined our keyframe animations, the next step is to apply it to one or more elements using the various animation properties</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>ANIMATION PROPERTIES
          <ul>
            <li>animation-name: used to attach an animation to an element</li>
            <li>animation-duration: defines the length of time (in seconds or milliseconds) an animation takes to complete one iteration (all the way through, from 0% to 100%)</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
          <ul>
            <li>animation-timing-function: determines how the animation will progress over its duration</li>
            <li>- options are: ease, linear, ease-in, ease-out, ease-in-out</li>
            <li>animation-iteration-count: define how many times the animation will play through</li>
            <li>animation-direction: sets the direction (from 0% to 100%) </li>
            <li>animation-delay: define how many milliseconds or seconds to wait before the browser begins the animation</li>
            <li>animation-fill-mode: defines what happens before the first animation iteration begins and after the last animation iteration concludes</li>
            <li>available values are none, forwards, backwards, or both</li>
            <li>animation-play-state: defines whether the animation is running or paused</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>Animation shorthand
          <ul>
            <li>To declare multiple animations on an element, include a grouping for each animation name, with each shorthand grouping separated by a comma</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <br/>

        <p class="title">Chapter 12: Canvas, SVG, and Drag and Drop</p>
          
        <p>Canvas
          <ul>
            <li>drawing on the canvas is done using JavaScript</li>
            <li>All drawing on the canvas happens via the Canvas JavaScript API</li>
            <li>Context: the place where your drawing is rendered</li>
            <li>strokeStyle and fillStyle are set on a context object</li>
            <li>take one of three values: a string representing a color, a CanvasGradient object, or a CanvasPattern object</li>
            <li>Stroke: the border of the shape being drawn</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>Coordinate System
          <ul>
            <li>the top-left corner is (0,0). If the canvas is 200 pixels by 200 pixels, then the bottom-right corner is (200,200)</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>anonymous function
          <ul>
            <li>are much like regular functions except they are without names</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>Vocabulary
          <ul>
            <li>Paths create a blueprint for your lines, arcs, and shapes, but paths are invisible until you give them a stroke</li>
            <li>arc is a segment of a circle</li>
            <li>arc(x, y, radius, startAngle, endAngle, anticlockwise).</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>Accessibility Concerns
          <ul>
            <li>A major downside of canvas in its current form is its lack of accessibility</li>
            <li>canvas doesn’t create a DOM node, is not a text-based format, and is thus essentially invisible to tools such as screen readers.</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>SVG
          <ul>
            <li>Scalable Vector Graphics, a specific file format that allows you to describe vector graphics using XML</li>
            <li>vector images preserve their quality even as you blow them up or shrink them down</li>
            <li>viewBox attribute defines the starting location, width, and height of the SVG image</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>CANVAS VERSUS SVG
          <ul>
            <li>Canvas allows for pixel manipulation</li>
            <li>One downside of canvas is that it operates in what’s known as immediate mode. This means that if you ever want to add more to the canvas, you’re unable to simply add to what’s already there</li>
            <li>What you draw to SVG is accessible via the DOM, because its mode is Retained Mode, meaning that the structure of the image is preserved in the XML document that describes it</li>
            <li>SVG also has, at this time, a more complete set of tools to help you work with it</li>
            <li>since SVG is a file format you can’t manipulate SVG images the way you can manipulate pixels on canvas</li>
          </ul>
        </p>

        <p>DRAG AND DROP
          <ul>
            <li>Drag and Drop API: allows us to specify that certain elements are draggable, and then specify what should happen when these draggable elements are dragged over or dropped onto other elements on the page</li>
            <li>two major kinds of functionality you can implement with Drag and Drop: 1) dragging files from your computer into a web page—in combination with the File API, 2) dragging elements into other elements on the same page</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>several steps to adding drag and drop
          <ol>
            <li>Set the draggable attribute on any HTML elements you’d like to be draggable</li>
            <li>Add an event listener for the dragstart event on any draggable HTML elements</li>
            <li>Add an event listener for the dragover and drop events on any elements that you want to have accept dropped items.</li>
          </ol>
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
          <ul>
            <li>draggable is not a Boolean attribute, so you have to explicitly set it to true</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>DataTransfer objects
          <ul>
            <li>allow us to set and get data about the elements that are being dragged</li>
            <li>define two pieces of information: 1) the type of data we’re saving of the draggable element, 2) the value of the data itself</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <br/>
