        <p class="title">Chapter 10: Testing and Debugging</p>

        <p>Errors, Exceptions, and Warnings
          <ul>
            <li>System error ― there’s a problem with the system or external devices with which the program is interacting.</li>
            <li>Programmer error ― the program contains incorrect syntax or faulty logic; it could even be as simple as a typo.</li>
            <li>User error ― the user has entered data incorrectly, which the program is unable to handle.</li>
            <li>An exception is an error that produces a return value that can then be used by the program to deal with the error.</li>
            <li>Stack trace: a sequence of functions or method calls that lead to the point where the error occurred</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        Strict Mode
        <p>
          <ul>
            <li>Writing code in strict mode can also help improve its clarity and speed, since it follows conventions and will throw exceptions if any sloppy code practices are used.</li>
            <li>Not using strict mode is often referred to as 'sloppy mode' as it’s forgiving of sloppy programming practices.</li>
            <li>Strict mode encourages a better quality of JavaScript to be written.</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          LINTING TOOLS
          <ul>
            <li>They are designed to highlight any sloppy programming practices or syntax errors, and will complain if certain style conventions are not followed</li>
            <li>Linting tools are also useful for enforcing a programming style guide</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          Error Objects
          <br>
          There are seven more error objects used for specific errors:
          <ol>
            <li>EvalError is not used in the current ECMAScript specification and only retained for backwards compatibility. It was used to identify errors when using the global eval() function.</li>
            <li>RangeError is thrown when a number is outside an allowable range of values.</li>
            <li>ReferenceError is thrown when a reference is made to an item that doesn’t exist. For example, calling a function that hasn't been defined.</li>
            <li>SyntaxError is thrown when there’s an error in the code’s syntax.</li>
            <li>TypeError is thrown when there’s an error in the type of value used; for example, a string is used when a number is expected.</li>
            <li>URIError is thrown when there’s a problem encoding or decoding the URI.</li>
            <li>InternalError is a non-standard error that is thrown when an error occurs in the JavaScript engine. A common cause of this too much recursion.</li>
          </ol>
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>Exception Handling
          <br>
          TRY, CATCH, AND FINALLY
          <ul>
            <li>If we suspect a piece of code will result in an exception, we can wrap it in a try block. This will run the code inside the block as normal, but if an exception occurs it will pass the error object that is thrown onto a catch block</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>TEST-DRIVEN DEVELOPMENT
          <ul>
            <li>Test-driven development(TDD) is the process of writing tests before any actual code.</li>
            <li>Code is refactored to make it faster, more readable, and remove any repetition. The code is continually tested at each stage to make sure it continues to work</li>
          </ul>
          Workflow:
          <ol>
            <li>Write tests (that initially fail)</li>
            <li>Write code to pass the tests</li>
            <li>Refactor the code</li>
            <li>Test refactored code</li>
            <li>Write more tests for new features</li>
          </ol>
        </p>
