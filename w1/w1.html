        <p>“If you design for the smallest, least powerful device first, then you will focus on the content, and your core functionality. That leads to simple, beautiful apps. If you do it the other way around, it’ll be like trying to put a marshmallow into a piggy bank, which is neither simple, nor beautiful.” – Joel Marsh</p>
          
        <p>Sites have been developed for desktops primarily.
          <br><br>
          Paradigm Shift: <br>
          2007 -> Mobile uprising, exploded around 2011<br>
          2011 -> Desktop peak, start of decline of sales<br>
          <br>
          Responsive != Mobile first
          <br>
          Responsive retrofitting: creating a mobile view after a desktop version was already created
          <br>
          Mobile First
          -	Will address constraints of mobile size and bandwidth
          <br>
          Start Small and scale up</p>

          <p>Steve Jobs: “Its really heard to design products by focus groups. A lot of times, people don’t know what they want until you show them.”</p>

          49% use a one-handed grip<br>
          <br>
          Speed Matters:<br>
          Google .5 second delay = 20% drop in traffic<br>
          Bing 2 second delay = 4% drop in revenue<br>
          AOL Fastest 10% of users stay 50% longer<br>
          <br>
          Reduce image use on sites<br>
          Use SVG and Webfonts = lower bandwidth<br>
          Minify CSS and JS files<br>
          Compresss/GZIP  to eliminate unnecessary data</p>

          <p>Stewart Alsop:<br>
          “The trouble with software is…it sucks. That’s not a nice thing to say, but it’s a fundamental truth. Software customers – you, me, CIOs of multibillion-dollar companies…have learned to live with mediocre software. We do not count on software to be intuitively easy to understand or to work consistenly. Instead, we make do.”</p>
          
          
          <p class="title">Video 4:</p>
          <p>“[The constraints of Mobile] push you toward more focused, simplified solutions. You can only fit so much on the screen, people often have to wait for it, and they’re unlikely to give you their full attention. So make it easy to understand and use and focus on the important things first. Mobile I a great forcing function for simplicity.” – Luke Wroblewski</p>

          <p>“End-users, not technologies, shape the market. Consequently marketers need to stay abreast not only of technological developments but also of the way people respond to them.” – Matt Haig</p>
          
          <p>Mobile Ads were minimal in the 90’s. In the early 2000’s, advertisers saw a great way to increase their visibility. In the 2010’s, ads increased even more, but the space used on mobile devices became used less for content and more for ad space.<br>
          <br>
          Spending has increased for advertising has increased remarkability over the past 5 years.<br>
          <br>
          Making ads nicer:<br>
          -	Make ads smaller and more simple. <br>
          -	Don’t make ads full sized to start with. Can become bigger when clicked or when needed. No pop-ups.<br>
          -	Parallaxed ads help engage the customer more<br>
          <br>
          “The fallen state of our internet is a direct, in unintentional. , consequence of choosing advertising as the default model to support online content and services.” – Ethan Zukerman – Creator of the Pop-up ad
          <br><br>
          Stop using pop-ups and pop-overs<br>
          Use advertising sparingly<br>
          Make sure the ads are unobtrusive. Make use of content first.</p>
